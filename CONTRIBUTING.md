## Releasing a New Version

Navigate to the [New Release]([https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang-github-action/releases](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang-github-action/releases/new)) form for this repo.

Make sure `Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace` is checked.

* **If you have already cut a tag**, you can choose that tag in the form.
* **If you have not pushed a tag**, write the name of the tag you want to create, for example `v1.2.3`, and make sure the target is set to the `main` branch.

You do not need to provider a release description, but you should write a release title which starts with the tag name, ex: `v1.2.3 Add support for My New Feature`.
